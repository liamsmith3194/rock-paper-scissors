## User Experience (UX)

### First Time Visitor Goals

1. As a first time vistor, I want a clear understanding of the interactive game on show.
2. As a first time vistor, I want a brief description of the rules in order to win the game.
3. As a first time vistor, I want to have live scoring round by round.
4. As a first time vistor, I want to enjoy the game and come back again and again.        

### Returning Visitor Goals

1. As a returning vistor, I want to enjoy the game as much as I did the first time.       

-   ### Design

    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   With the cartoon images used for the hand gestures, the colour scheme is very simple with the body being grey (#686868).
        The scoreboard uses win, draw, lose colours (green #3EA62D, black #000000, red #FF0000) just to add some brighter text.
    -   #### Typography
        -   One typeface is used throughout the site (Bebas Neue) which is clear to read and stands out enough to draw the user into the game. The game title has a 5px letter spacing and the remaining text has 2px letter spacing to increase readability. Finally, Bebas Neue has a fallback of sans-serif incase of any import issues.
    -   #### Imagery
        -   As mentioned above the fun striking cartoony images used for the hand gestures look great and work really nicely as the buttons with the grey circular borders.

### Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section

-   #### First Time Visitor Goals REPLACE WHEN DONE

    Q1. As a first time vistor, I want a clear understanding of the interactive game on show. 

    -   As soon as users enter the site, they are drawn to the hero image spread across the width of the screen with the tag line offer.
    -   Scrolling down there is a clear message showing what services are available from the use of clipped images and opacity captions.
    -   The about section is presented cleanly, split into three sections with a nice use of icons around the qualifications. 
    -   Immediately the use of shadow around the testimonial boxes stands out. A simple name and quote layout works well.
    -   Again the subtle use of opcaity is the driving force behind the contact page with the main form standing out in white. The change of colour on hover is a nice touch especially on the submit button.

    Q2. As a first time vistor, I want a brief description of the rules in order to win the game.

    -   This is very easy to see from the services section using the images and the short descriptions.
    -   The contact form also links to the services on offer with the 'Goal' dropdown.

    Q3. As a first time vistor, I want to have live scoring round by round.

    -   There is no content from the site that would offend or make any user feel uncomfortable.

    Q4. As a first time vistor, I want to enjoy the game and come back again and again.

    -   At the bottom of the site, there is a map spread across the whole screen showing the location of company. This also has the option to show directions using the in-built link which opens in a new tab.

### Code TBC

-   Love Maths (Walkthrough Project) 

-   Below is a screenshot showing the result **before** the StackOverflow Code:

-   The testimonials page was created using Flexbox from [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/). This was used to enable the tablet screen size (and smaller) to view the testimonials as a list and one column. 

-   The blurred shadow effect used on the testimonials was taken from [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_box-shadow.asp), but amended to the developers criteria in terms of colour, depth and strength.

### Content

-   All content was written by the developer.

### Digital Artwork

-   The images used for the hand gestures were sourced from the World Rock Paper Scissors Association [(WRPSA)](https://wrpsa.com/the-official-rules-of-rock-paper-scissors)

### Mentions TBC

-   My Mentor for answering my questions throughout.

-   Slack users for constructive feedback and suggestions for improvement.
