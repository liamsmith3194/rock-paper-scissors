-   ### Design

    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   A minimal but clean colour scheme used with just two main colours being black and white.
    -   #### Typography
        -   The striking Bebas Neue typeface works really well with conservative Montserrat; used for the main body of the website. The difference in style creates a clean modern look and feel. Both typefaces have a fallback of sans-serif incase of any import issues.
    -   #### Imagery
        -   The first thing you see is the background hero image and horizontal tag line, designed to stun the vistor's attention and draw them in to see what is on offer.
        - The use of opacity and imagery increases the clean and concise theme of the website but still informing the user of the options available.

-   ### Wireframes

    -   Figma Desktop Wireframe - [View](https://www.figma.com/file/ciXYUYV361qot5MCN7Z5hF/Rock%2C-Paper%2C-Scissors-Shoot---Desktop?node-id=0%3A1)

### Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section

-   #### First Time Visitor Goals

    Q1. As a first time vistor, I want a clear understanding of the purpose of the website.

    -   As soon as users enter the site, they are drawn to the hero image spread across the width of the screen with the tag line offer.
    -   Scrolling down there is a clear message showing what services are available from the use of clipped images and opacity captions.
    -   The about section is presented cleanly, split into three sections with a nice use of icons around the qualifications. 
    -   Immediately the use of shadow around the testimonial boxes stands out. A simple name and quote layout works well.
    -   Again the subtle use of opcaity is the driving force behind the contact page with the main form standing out in white. The change of colour on hover is a nice touch especially on the submit button.

    Q2. As a first time vistor, I want a concise description of the fitness goals this personal trainer concentrates on.

    -   This is very easy to see from the services section using the images and the short descriptions.
    -   The contact form also links to the services on offer with the 'Goal' dropdown.

    Q3. As a first time vistor, I want to feel comfortable with the content and imagery I am viewing.

    -   There is no content from the site that would offend or make any user feel uncomfortable.

    Q4. As a first time vistor, I need to know where the company is based and how to get there.

    -   At the bottom of the site, there is a map spread across the whole screen showing the location of company. This also has the option to show directions using the in-built link which opens in a new tab.   

    Q5. As a first time vistor, I want to know about the personal trainer.
    1.  What qualifications does he have?
    2.  How long has the personal trainer been working for?
    3.  Why should I book a session?

    -   The qualifications are clearly presented in the about section using the official titles and centred around dumbbell icons.
    -   The very first sentence gives the users confidence based on the "over 15 years of personal training"
    -   The final paragraph provides a handy link to the contact form and provides the first piece of motivational text in order to use said contact form.

    Q6. As a first time vistor, can I trust this person? Have they been reviewed well by previous clients are there numerous testimonials for me to look at. Do they have a social media presence which is regularly updated and followed.

    -   All the testimonials posted are shown with first and seconds names and contain speech marks so that you know that they are direct quotes.
    -   Links to Facebook, Twitter and Instagram are found at the bottom of the website and open in a new tab when clicked. Keeping them on the page after the form has been submited increases the continuity.

-   The website has been displayed on various devices such as Desktop PC, iMac, Laptop, iPhoneX, iPad & iPad mini.

-   The blurred shadow effect used on the testimonials was taken from [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_box-shadow.asp), but amended to the developers criteria in terms of colour, depth and strength.
